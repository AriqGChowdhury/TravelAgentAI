# TravelAgentAI

Travel Agent AI is an intelligent assistant designed to help users plan their travels by providing personalized recommendations for destinations, accommodations, and activities. It leverages advanced AI to suggest the best options based on user preferences, location, and budget while also delivering real-time updates on flights, hotels, and things to do in the destination city.

Unlike most travel assistants that focus only on static recommendations or real-time updates separately, Travel Agent AI combines both.

## Technology Stack
This project was created using: Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SocketIO, LLaMa, and APIs.

- APIs for Real-Time Data

   → Used to fetch live flight, and hotel ensuring up-to-date travel planning.

- Custom Data Formatting & Display
  
  → Instead of showing raw JSON, the system processes and presents the data in a structured, user-friendly format.

- Natural Language Processing for User Queries
  
  → Allows users to ask questions about their trip (e.g., "What’s my hotel check-in time?"), making the assistant more interactive.

- Python & Flask
  
  → Chosen for backend flexibility and seamless integration of API responses with AI-powered interactions.
